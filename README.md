# Game of Life
This is a simple implementation of the famous Conway's Game of Life using pygame. You can read more about it here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
### Basic Rules
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction
### Running the code
Just download the `main.py` file and run it through your terminal using `python3 main.py`
That's it!
